class Args:
    """
    This class represents a list of instances in an image.
    It stores the attributes of instances (e.g., boxes, masks, labels, scores) as "fields".
    All fields must have the same ``__len__`` which is the number of instances.

    All other (non-field) attributes of this class are considered private:
    they must start with '_' and are not modifiable by a user.

    Some basic usage:

    1. Set/get/check a field:

       .. code-block:: python

          instances.gt_boxes = Boxes(...)
          print(instances.pred_masks)  # a tensor of shape (N, H, W)
          print('gt_masks' in instances)

    2. ``len(instances)`` returns the number of instances
    3. Indexing: ``instances[indices]`` will apply the indexing on all the fields
       and returns a new :class:`Instances`.
       Typically, ``indices`` is a integer vector of indices,
       or a binary mask of length ``num_instances``

       .. code-block:: python

          category_3_detections = instances[instances.pred_classes == 3]
          confident_detections = instances[instances.scores > 0.9]
